## Hey there 👋

My name is Joshua Baylasy and I'm currently a student at UC Davis 🐄.

I've mostly worked with community organizations doing all types of different work like: outreaching, education and videography/telling stories.

When I'm not at my computer, I love to play with my dog or work on side projects, aka whatever random thing I see on the internet.

I have a passion for improvement and creating things that I actually care about and want to see succeed.
