I've wanted to create a custom startpage for a while now since it's just so much more convenient to have all your important tabs at a click of a button.

### What is a startpage? 
Instead of a your usual google homepage we can have something like this:

{{< image src="/img/startpageexample.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}


> See how much better that looks?

Here's the github repo if you're interested in looking at my code: https://github.com/joshbouy/terminal-startpage

But I just followed this guide: https://stpg.tk/guides/terminal-like-startpage/ 

and also look at [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/)
